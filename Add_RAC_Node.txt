Current scenario:


I have two nodes in the cluster presently.


Host names :


- host01.example.com


- host02.example.com


Node to be added : 

- host03.example.com


Procedure:


————————————

 Prepare the machine for third node

————————————


 — Set kernel parameters

 — Install required rpm’s

 — Create users/groups

  — configure oracleasm

root@host03#oracleasm configure -i

                       oracleasm exit

                       oracleasm init

                       oracleasm scandisks

                       oracleasm listdisks


              all asm disks will be listed


– Configure ssh connectivity for grid user among all 3 nodes –


   –  On  node3 as grid user


[grid@host03 .ssh]$ssh-keygen -t rsa

 

                             ssh-keygen -t dsa

 

                             cd /home/grid/.ssh

                              cat *.pub > host03

 

                             scp host03 host01:/home/grid/.ssh/


[grid@host03 .ssh] $ssh host01 

                           – Enter password


 [grid@host01 ~]$cd /home/grid/.ssh

                          

                          cat host03 >> authorized_keys

 

                         scp authorized_keys host02:/home/grid/.ssh/

                         scp authorized_keys host03:/home/grid/.ssh/


– Test ssh connectivity on all 3 nodes as grid user –

– run following  on all 3 nodes twice as grid user–


echo ssh host01 hostname >> a.sh

echo ssh host02 hostname >> a.sh

echo ssh host03 hostname >> a.sh

echo ssh host01-priv hostname >> a.sh

echo ssh host02-priv hostname >> a.sh

echo ssh host03-priv hostname  >> a.sh

 

chmod +x a.sh

 

./a.sh


– Run cluster verify to check that host03 can be added as node –

grid host01# cluvfy stage -pre crsinst -n host03 -verbose


– if time synchronization problem, restart ntpd service on each node

– Error grid is not a member of dba group – ignore


grid@host01 ~]$. oraenv –+ASM1


[grid@host01 ~]$ cd /u01/app/11.2.0/grid/oui/bin


– Add node 


[grid@host01 bin]$./addNode.sh -silent “CLUSTER_NEW_NODES={host03}” “CLUSTER_NEW_VIRTUAL_HOSTNAMES={host03-vip}”



– Execute oraInstroot.sh and root.sh on node3  as root –


[root@host03]#/u01/app/oraInventory/oraInstroot.sh

                         /u01/app/11.2.0/grid/root.sh



– check from host01 that node has been added –


host01 grid > crsctl stat res -t


– Start any resources if they are not up already –


host01 grid > crsctl start resource <resource name>
